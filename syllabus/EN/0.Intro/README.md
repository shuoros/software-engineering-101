# Intro

Since I was hoping you could focus on learning valuable things in this roadmap, I will refrain from talking too much and go straight to the point.

### Which programming language should I start with?

This section is for those without programming experience and who do not know which language to start learning. So, if you know what programming language you want, you can go to the next part.

The first thing you have to do to start this path is to choose a programming language. But you don't need to get involved in selecting the best possible language; Because:

- There is no best programming language, and any language can be the best for a specific application.
- It doesn't matter which language you start with; The most important thing is to start. When you learn programming, you can switch to any language you want and work with it.

I myself started programming with C++ language, and if you ask me, I suggest you do the same.

Since I found excellent explanations on the internet to prove this claim, I suggest you go yourself and read why you should start your programming with C++:
- [Why is C++ a good first language to learn?](https://www.educative.io/blog/c-is-a-good-first-language-to-learn)
- [Why CS students *must* learn C++ as their primary programming language?](https://medium.com/@vardanator/why-cs-students-must-learn-c-as-their-main-programming-language-6d3b4f8720bd)
- [A reply on Reddit to someone who asked if C++ is an excellent language to learn as a beginner?](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2n2t6z/comment/cm9vqf1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I emphasize again that it doesn't matter what language you start learning. It is essential to learn programming concepts in depth. Once you learn this, you can code in any programming language.

If you are still in doubt about starting to learn C++, then; I have prepared a table of what each programming language is useful for so that you can more easily decide which language to start with. You can see that table 
[here](https://github.com/shuoros/software-engineering-101/blob/main/syllabus/EN/Extras/Languages-and-their-use-cases.md).

Finally, when you have chosen the programming language you want to start with, you can find courses and books related to the language you wish to [here](https://github.com/shuoros/software-engineering-101/blob/main/syllabus/EN/Extras/Tutorials-and-books.md) and start learning.

### Planning

The most important thing to succeed in anything is to have a plan.

But more important than having a plan is to follow the plan!

What kind of plan you make is entirely up to you. If you have little time to learn, learn one lesson a week; if you have a lot of time, learn one lesson every two days. As I said, this subject is entirely up to everyone, and no one can come and create a learning plan for everyone. But whatever plan you make, stick to it. If you do this, be sure that you will succeed.

### Exercises and Projects

The exercises that I will give you are all [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problems. I tried to put problems related to that lesson in each lesson, so be sure to create an account in Leetcode right now so that you can submit your solutions.

**Important note:** The solutions to the problems I am giving you can be found on the internet. I have a repository called [LeetcodeHub](https://github.com/shuoros/leetcodehub), where I put the solutions to the problems I solve, and even Leetcode itself has made solutions available to some of the problems. But what I want from you is to try to solve all of the problems yourself, even if it takes a few days to solve a question, but still struggle with it so that you can solve it. Consider each of these issues a challenge you faced when you worked in a big company (I hope you can work in the best places in the world ‚ù§), and there may not be anyone there who has already faced your problem. And wants to solve it, so you and you alone have to deal with the problems. So start training for that time now.

Finally, when you solve each question, compare it with the solution I provided in [LeetcodeHub](https://github.com/shuoros/leetcodehub). If you couldn't do it better than me, check my code and see why your code couldn't do better than mine. But if you did it better than me, you must request that I put your code with your name as a better solution.

At the end of each chapter, I defined a project related to the lessons of the same chapter and even previous chapters; by doing them, more and more concepts will be registered in your brain, and you will gain more experience. I suggest you do these projects and put them on your GitHub.

I tried to define these projects more as implementing different games or applications so that they are fun and involve you with real challenges.

### English; More important than programming
**If you are a native English speaker, you don't need to read this section.**

Finally, the best advice I can give you is to improve your English. Whatever you want to do in this industry, you need to be fluent in English. From watching tutorials on YouTube and other platforms or finding the solution to your code's bug in Stackoverflow.

So learn English more than programming because you need to be able to communicate with other programmers from all over the world, ask them for help or even ask them to help you.
